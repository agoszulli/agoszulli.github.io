## WELCOME!

I am María Agostina Zulli, I hold a Master in Economics from the National University of La Plata (UNLP) and a B.A. degree in Economics from the National University of Tucumán (UNT).  

Currently I am a junior researcher at [CEDLAS](https://www.cedlas.econo.unlp.edu.ar/wp/en/) (Centro de Estudios Distributivos, Laborales y Sociales) and [GENLAC](https://genlac.econo.unlp.edu.ar/home-en/). 

My research interests include gender economics, and labor economics.
